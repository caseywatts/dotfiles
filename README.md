## Setup

### Getting the files there
To set this up quickly for himself, Casey would:

```
git clone https://github.com/caseywatts/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.* ~/; rm ~/.git
```

That code ^ but in English:
- clone this gist to `~/.dotfiles`
- symlink the dotfiles to the home directory where they'll be used
  - (all files that start with `.` except the `.git` directory)
  - (do you know a cleaner way to do this than the `rm`? lol I'd love to know!)

### Other Setup
- Install `zsh-syntax-highlighting`, see [here](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md#oh-my-zsh)
- Terminal
  - make the background black and the text white
  - make ctrl+tab work [see here](https://superuser.com/questions/26100/using-ctrl-tab-to-switch-between-tabs-in-mac-terminal-app)
  - check "Use Option as Meta key" under "Terminal -> Preferences -> Profiles -> Keyboard" to make move-by-word and delete-by-word work (alt+left, alt+right, alt+backspace)

## Maintaining it
These dotfiles can now be managed by git commands `add, commit, push, pull, etc` in the `~/.dotfiles` directory ðŸŽ‰
